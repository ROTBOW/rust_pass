Project: Rust Password Manager (RustPass)
A lightweight, secure password manager that lets you store, retrieve, and delete passwords via a command-line interface.

Features:
✅ Encrypt & store passwords in a local database (SQLite or a JSON file)
✅ Retrieve passwords with a master password authentication
✅ Delete passwords when no longer needed
✅ Generate strong passwords
✅ Use Rust’s rand crate for randomness and aes-gcm or argon2 for encryption

Tech Stack:
Rust
clap (for CLI handling)
serde & serde_json (for data storage)
rand (for password generation)
aes-gcm or argon2 (for encryption)
Why?
Practical: You’ll actually use it.
Security-focused: Rust’s memory safety helps prevent vulnerabilities.
Performance: Rust is great for fast CLI tools.
Learning Opportunity: Work with file handling, encryption, and CLI interaction.
